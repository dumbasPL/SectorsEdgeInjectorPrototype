# SectorsEdgeInjectorPrototype

This was a prototype of a CLR injector for a game called sectors edge

It can inject a pure CLR binary from memory and can even inject into proceses that do not have clr loaded yet/at all

This was later used to develop a vmread(rip project [*]) based injector that could inject it into a running vm.

The code is messy because I was only interested in getting the shellcode and testing stuff.
